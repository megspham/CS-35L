Lab 4

mkdir 35Week4
cd 35Week4

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

We need to unzip the tar file archive
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz 
which extracts, filters through gzip and xz, and prints out info


1. gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

There was a warning when verifying keyring; states that the key is not
certified with a trusted signature. This is because the computer cannot
tell if the signature is from the owner or not. 

2. Install Coreutils into temporary directory: 
cd ..
mkdir lab4Install

cd coreutils-8.29
cat INSTALL 

Inside the INSTALL file, it gives you basic instructions on how to use
configure and make. 

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/meganp/35Week4/lab4Install
make

make install

cd ..
cd lab4Install
cd bin
ls -l


3. Reproduce bug? 
make a temporary directory
mkdir foo
cd foo
~/35Week4/lab4Install/bin/ls -fA

This outputs . and .. 


4. apply patch of Bug#30963 Message #10 
get the patch file out of the email attachment
we can see that we only need the patch file regarding ls.c 

wget https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?msg=10;bug=30963;att=1;
filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch > Coreutils.patch

go into the coreutils-8.29 folder to apply patch
cd 35Week4
cd coreutils-8.29
patch -p1 < /u/cs/ugrad/meganp/35Week4/Coreutils.patch

We see that one part of the patch fails at NEWS, but fortunately, we 
only need to look at ls.c and it was a success patching that file


we are in coreutils-8.29
need to configure -> ./configure
make

When running make command, there is an error because automake-1.15 is missing
on my system.
downloaded automake
autoreconf -f -i
make 


6. check!

cd ..
cd foo
/u/cs/ugrad/meganp/35Week4/bin/ls -fA
outputs nothing, which is correct! does not output . and ..
