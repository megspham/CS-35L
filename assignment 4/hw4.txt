Homework 4: Rewriting a script

wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/randline.py


Q1. Does the patch improve the performance of ls or make it worse?
Briefly explain.

The patch does improve the performance of ls because if we check out
the patch file and what it does to the ls.c code, then we can see that
it gets rid of the if statement, so that is one less conditional
statement to go through. Furthermore, the flags are able to override
each other, depending on the order.  

Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the
default one, what else should you watch out for? Might this new version of
Coreutils introduce other problems with your application?

If my company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the
default one, I would have to watch out for any other files that also
use the version of ls with the bug inside. This patch only fixes this one
ls file, so if another directory/file utilizes ls, then we would have
to patch that one up as well. 
 
Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like
/dev/null, and why?

If the script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, there is an
index error because the file attempts to print out lines from a file
that is empty. As a result, it cannot access an empty file and get its
length, so there is an IndexError.

python randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.18/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277,
  in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if
    seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range


Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather
than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts
by using the command python3 instead of python.)

When this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, there
is a syntax error because Python3 is an updated version, so we would
need to change the outdated script. 

python3 randline.py /dev/null
  File "/w/home.27/cs/ugrad/meganp/randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


Q5. What happens when your shuf.py script is invoked with Python 2
rather than Python 3, and why?
With this code, the shuf.py script ran fine with Python 2 and Python 3.
However, usually, Python 3 is not backwardly compatible with Python 2
because some libraries/code are only exclusive only to Python 3, since
Python 2 is more outdated.
